        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the 
            acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. 
            Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. 
            Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal
             or informal settings and any experience that has 
            a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational.
             The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten,
              primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

             A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.
              There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, 
            this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond 
            skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.[2]


            Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
            Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens 
            as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and
             organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.[4]
            
            In China, Confucius (551â€“479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of
             China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his
              Analects were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.[5] </p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is teaching students. 
            Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, 
            certified teacher of the subject. Most school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational 
            choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces (e.g. classrooms), 
            student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.[14][15]

            The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO as a statistical base to compare education systems.
            [16]In 1997, it defined 7 levels of education and 25 fields, though the fields were later separated out to form a different project.
             The current version ISCED 2011 has 9 rather than 7 levels, created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels.
              It also extended the lowest level (ISCED 0) to cover a new sub-category of early childhood educational development programmes, 
              which target children below the age of 3 years</p>
